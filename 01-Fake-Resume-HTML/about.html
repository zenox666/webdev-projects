<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Beluga asks Hecker to heck the dictionary, which he does. Beluga and Hecker
  then decide to hack new words. First, Beluga wants Hecker to add Beluga, but
  since it was in there as a whale, Beluga asks Hecker for the meaning to be
  HIM, and so Hecker does it despite some doubt, and all the Beluga whales in
  the world turn into "Sussy Cat" that look like Beluga. Skittle-Chan also wants
  to be in, so Hecker adds her as the "Most annoying Creature in existence" and
  added that she had died that day, and he also added Eugene (as an egg). Ms.
  White questioned if he was hacking the dictionary, and so they decided to put
  her mom in jail, so she sent them to the office, which they changed to mean
  Disney World and as such, went to Disney World.
